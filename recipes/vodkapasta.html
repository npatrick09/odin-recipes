    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz pasta (penne or any short pasta)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vodka</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan (optional, for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil or butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and sauté for about 1 minute, just until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vodka and let it simmer for 2–3 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce to the pan and stir to combine. Let it simmer gently for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, stir in the heavy cream, and season with a pinch of salt. Simmer for another 2 minutes, until the sauce is smooth and slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
