    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the smell of warm, buttery pancakes in the morning—and these buttermilk pancakes deliver just that with barely any fuss. Made with basic pantry ingredients, this recipe yields a stack of fluffy, golden pancakes that are crisp at the edges and soft in the center.</p>
    <p>Perfect for lazy weekends or quick weekday breakfasts, these pancakes come together in minutes and taste like a treat. Add your favorite toppings—like maple syrup, berries, or a pat of butter—for a cozy, satisfying start to your day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (plus more for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then mix in the buttermilk and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy; don&rsquo;t overmix.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly buttered skillet or nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2–3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set. Flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with butter, syrup, or your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
